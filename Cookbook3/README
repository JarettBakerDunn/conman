RUN_TEST_SUITE runs the tests in each directory using the source in 
 the directory above (../conman)

RUN_PARALLEL.sh runs the tests in each directory using the source in 
 the directory above (../conman).  It assumes a multi-threaded machine and
 it's not very cleaver.  It launches the first CPU jobs, then when the last
 of those ends, it starts the next CPU jobs.  This assumes the last job started
 takes the longest.

CLEAN_TEST_SUITE deletes the output programs (should be unnnecessary but safe)

Make_table.sh - reads the output and create a latex file (blankenbach.tex), 
 then compile it and creates a postscript file: blankenbach.ps  You may need to 
 edit the locations of latex and dvips.

This enables one to obtain the accuracy of the mixed formulation without incurring the additional computational expense engendered by the auxiliary field of the mixed method. Applications and numerical examples are presented for problems with constraints which can be difficult to enforce in finite element approximations and have often dictated the use of mixed principles. These include thin beams and plates, and linear and nonlinear incompressible and nearly incompressible continuum problems in solid and fluid mechanics.",

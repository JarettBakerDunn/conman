Converting ConMan Output to VTK Visualization Files
===================================================

In this directory you will find a python file that can help you convert
the output from ConMan into VTK files you can visualize with programs like
Paraview or Mayavi2.

In order to use this, you will need the numpy and pyvtk python modules,
which are available from the following websites:

    * http://numpy.scipy.org/
    * http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/pyvtk/

The file conman_vtk.py is meant to be imported as a python module from
another script. It defines a number of functions for splitting
and parsing the temperature file output from ConMan, and for writing
the resulting data into VTK files.

For an example of how to use the conman_vtk module, we show how the
cover image seen in the ConMan manual was generated. In particular,
note how the conman_vtk python module is used in the generate_cover.py
script.

See the README file in the cover/ subdirectory for further instructions.

This example consists of a thermal convection model with fully
developed downwellings and upwellings. The computation is performed
on a 4x1 rectangular domain with 256x64 uniform square elements.
This convection model uses a Rayleigh number of 10^{6} and constant
viscosity, with free slip velocity boundary conditions applied on all
sides and constant temperature boundary conditions on the bottom and top
layer.

To run this example, you will need compile ConMan without
the -DIMPLICIT and -DPICARD flags, so you will need to modify
FFLAGS in either Makefile-gfort or Makefile-ifort.

Now, run the command 'make explicit', and copy the resulting
conman.exp executable into this directory.

Finally, run the example with './conman.exp < runfile'
